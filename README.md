# Backup Container

Automated, encrypted backup and archiving to [MEGA.nz](https://mega.nz) with Discord notifications, managed via Docker Compose.

---

## Features

- **Automated Backups:** Scheduled zipping, encryption, and upload of folders to MEGA.nz.
- **Archiving:** Scheduled archival of file versions to a dedicated MEGA folder.
- **Encryption:** Uses [Picocrypt](https://github.com/HACKERALERT/Picocrypt) for strong encryption.
- **Notifications:** Sends status and error messages to Discord via webhooks.
- **Easy Setup:** All configuration via environment variables and Docker Compose.
- **Development Mode:** Includes a `dev` service for debugging and script development.
- **Multi-Architecture:** Supports both AMD64 and ARM64 builds and runs.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository and enter the directory:**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd backup-container
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   backup_cron=0 2 * * *         # Example: every day at 2am
   archive_cron=0 3 1 * *        # Example: 1st of every month at 3am
   mega_mail=your@email.com
   mega_password=yourpassword
   encryption_password=your_encryption_password
   mega_remote_folder=Backups
   archive_folder_name=Archives
   discord_webhook_url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
   discord_error_webhook_url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
   discord_archive_webhook_url=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
   ```

3. **Mount your data:**  
   By default, a source directory is mounted for backup. Adjust the `volumes` section in the compose files to specify which folders you want to back up or restore.

## Building Images

- **Build for AMD64 (default):**
  ```sh
  docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml build --no-cache backup_amd64
  ```

- **Build for ARM64:**
  ```sh
  docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml --profile arm64 build --no-cache backup_arm64
  ```

- **Build the Dev container (AMD64):**
  ```sh
  docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml --profile dev build --no-cache dev
  ```

---

## Running Containers

- **Run backup on AMD64 (default):**
  ```sh
  docker compose up backup_amd64
  ```

- **Run backup on ARM64:**
  ```sh
  docker compose --profile arm64 up backup_arm64
  ```

- **Run the Dev container (AMD64):**
  ```sh
  docker compose --profile dev up dev
  ```

---

## How It Works

- **Entrypoint:** `start-cron.sh` runs checks, sets up cron jobs for backup and archive scripts, and tails the log.
- **Backup:** `backup_procedures.sh` zips, encrypts, and uploads files, then notifies Discord.
- **Archive:** `archive_backups.sh` moves old file versions to an archive folder on MEGA and cleans up.
- **Checks:** `checks.sh` validates mounts, credentials, and MEGA folder existence before running jobs.
- **Dev Service:** The `dev` service mounts scripts and backup folders for live debugging and development.

## Logs

- All logs are written to `backup/backup_out/backup_logs.txt` and `archive_logs.txt`.
- Cron output is tailed in the container’s foreground.

---

## Customization

- **Add more folders to back up:**  
  Mount them under `/backup/backup_in/` in your compose file.
- **Change backup/archive schedules:**  
  Edit `BACKUP_CRON` and `ARCHIVE_CRON` in your `.env`.
- **Switch architecture:**  
  Use the `--profile arm64` flag for ARM64, or `--profile dev` for development.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Check logs in `backup/backup_out/`.
- Discord notifications will alert you to errors or issues.
- Ensure your MEGA credentials and folder names are correct.
